# Venmo_Email_Processing
Process Venmo emails in order to do something with Venmo payments.


Try to fill the gap of the lack of public Venmo API. Can process emails received from Venmo about a recent payment, and then do some action based on the content of the note.
One use case is enabling Venmo payments on a basic E-commerce site and automatically updating the payment status in a database when payment is completed.
